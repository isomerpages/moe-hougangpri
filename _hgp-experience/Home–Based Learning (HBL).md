<p>During the full HBL phase, schools will continue to provide instructions and support for students to access a range of online and hardcopy HBL materials and resources, so that learning continues uninterrupted.</p>
<h4><strong>Student Learning Space</strong></h4>
<p>Student Learning Space (SLS) is an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources and learning tools will be used for HBL.</p>
<p>Below is some information to assist your child in resolving login issues. We look forward to your support as we leverage on SLS to create meaningful learning experiences for our students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SLS is accessible through internet browsers on either Windows PC, Mac, iPad or Android tablets. For a good user experience, tablets should have a screen size of at least 7 inches.
