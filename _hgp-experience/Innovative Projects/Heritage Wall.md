<p>The Hougang Primary School Heritage Wall was officially launched on 18
November 2020 by Ms Low Yoke Kiew, Zonal Director, Schools North. The unveiling
of the wall coincided with the 20th Anniversary of Hougang Primary School.</p>
<p>The Heritage Wall, titled My Story, was conceptualized and designed in
two phases. The first phase (right side of the wall) was completed in 2019.
It documents Hougang Primary School development and milestones. The heritage
and rich history of our school are also disseminated in the form of write-ups
and photos. A segment of the wall is dedicated to show the route taken
by students and teachers of Hougang Primary School as they walked from
the holding school to the school’s current site in 2000. At the centre
of the wall, there is an arcylic showcase which displays some artefacts
and momentos contributed by staff and alumni of Hougang Primary School.

<p>The second phase of the wall - Remembering Hougang - captures the diverse
and unique history of Hougang. Recognizing the rich heritage of these places
create a sense of appreciation for students as they explore the multicultural
and multilingual aspects of the community.</p>
<p>The highlight of our wall is that it is compatible with Microsoft HoloLens®.
By wearing the HoloLens, users will embark on an immersive mixed reality
experience. Users can experience and explore various aspect of activities
as they don the smart goggles. The Heritage Wall provides an avenue for
the extension of students’ learning as lessons can be linked to the Social
Studies Curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
