<p>Computational Thinking @ HGP focuses on equipping students with programming,
inventing and equipping students with makers' mindset of programming, inventing
and problem-solving skills. The skills identified are mapped to Bloom's
Taxonomy on Cognitive Domain. This mapping involves computational skills
at the application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation and creating levels.</p>

<h4><strong>Robotics in Education (RE) @ HGP</strong></h4>
<p>In promoting an innovative spirit in both our teachers and students, the
school initiates our Robotics in Education @ HGP by collaborating with
the robotics team from Ngee Ann Polytechic (NP). We signed a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) with NP, School of Engineering on Monday 22 October
2018 and is currently embarking on designing and producing in phases a
set of humanoid educational robot with capabilities listed below.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Robotic Teaching Assistant - Story-telling for English, introduction or
reinforcement of concepts for Science, Q&amp;A on simple calculations for
Math (addition, subtraction and multiplication tables)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robotic Concierge - Prattles greetings and event information, Smart Tray
Return (reminding students to keep the tables clean and return their cutleries
and utensils at the correct stations)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guided School Tour - Programmed to tour indoor areas for school events</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another objective of this partnership is to value add to not only the
teaching and learning but administrative and operational processes as well.</p>
<p><strong>By spearheading Robotics in Education, Hougang Primary is imbuing, nurturing and cultivating the 21<sup>st</sup> Century competencies in our students.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Critical and Inventive Thinking</strong>:</p>
<p>To be future-ready, our young need to be able to think critically, assess
options and make sound decisions. They should have a desire to learn, explore
and be prepared to think out of the box. They should not be afraid to make
mistakes and face challenges that may at first appear daunting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills</strong>:</p>
<p>With the Internet Revolution, information is often literally just a click
away. It is important that our young know what questions to ask, how to
sieve information and extract that which is relevant and useful. At the
same time, they need to be discerning so that they can shield themselves
from harm, while adopting ethical practices in cyberspace. The workplace
of the 21st Century requires our young to be able to work together in a
respectful manner to share responsibilities and make decisions with one
another to meet group goals. Importantly, they should also be able to communicate
their ideas clearly and effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Values at the Core of 21st Century Competencies (R3ICH):</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Respect</strong>: Believes in his own self-worth and the intrinsic
worth of all people.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility</strong>: Recognises that he has a duty to himself,
his family, community, nation and the world, and fulfils his responsibilities
with love and commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong>: Upholds ethical principles and has the moral
courage to stand up for what is right.</p>
<p><strong>Care</strong>: Acts with kindness and compassion, and contributes
to the betterment of the community and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Resilience</strong>: Has emotional strength and perseveres in
the face of challenges - manifesting courage, optimism, adaptability and
resourcefulness.</p>
<p><strong>Harmony</strong>: Seeks inner happiness and promotes social cohesion;
appreciating the unity and diversity of a multicultural society.</p>
<p>As mentioned by&nbsp;<em>Jeffrey Johnson in his article ‘Children, Robotics and Education’ in Artificial Life and Robotics’</em>,
robotics do support an innovative and creative approach to teaching and
learning. Robotics supports all STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering
and mathematics). There can also be connections to robotics across all
of the curriculum. For example, students can build and use robots to help
them understand the characters and plots of books they read.</p>
<p>Robotics provides students with opportunities to question, think about,
and create technological tools, rather than just becoming passive uses
of technology. It addresses key competencies such as: thinking; using language,
symbols, and text; managing self; relating to others; and participating
and contributing. Robotics can be fun and suitable for children with a
range of abilities. A robot never gets tired, never gets frustrated, and
is always consistent, which is important when teaching through repetition.
A robot’s friendly demeanour and patience will encourage learners with
special needs to step out of their shell and gives them the courage to
interact with their environment.</p>
