<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>We deliver a comprehensive programme designed to provide every HGPian
a multi-sensory and varied experience of Science beyond the classroom.
The purpose is to reach out to every child so that all can get a sense
of the world; igniting in every child a curiosity as well as an excitement
about the world at large.</p>
<p>The principles of social constructivism, experiential learning and inquiry-based
learning undergirds the school’s ALP STEM (Science).</p>

<p>In 2014, the school’s science programme was awarded MOE’s Applied Learning
Programme (ALP), allowing the school to run activities for all P1 to P6
HGPians. Some of these activities are an extension of the school’s science
curriculum, while there are those which are interdisciplinary and lastly,
those that are conducted as part of enrichment. All of which is intended
to provide meaningful and authentic contexts where scientific knowledge
and skills can be applied and where values and attitudes as well as 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century
competencies can be demonstrated and strengthened.</p>
