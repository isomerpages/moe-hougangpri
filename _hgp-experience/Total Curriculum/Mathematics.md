<p><strong>Problem Solving<br /></strong>Knowing how to solve problems is an important skill and an essential part of our lives. We need to spend considerable effort and time on describing how problem solving should be taught and learned.</p>
<p><strong>General Approach</strong></p>
<img style="width: 25%;" src="/images/math4.jpg">
<p><strong>Understand the Problem</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read the problem carefully to understand what is required</li>
<li>Break the problem up into smaller parts and understand each part</li>
<li>Visualise the information</li>
<li>Organise the information</li>
<li>Connect the information</li>
<li>Draw/Write the information into simpler form</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan What to do / Devise a Plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose an appropriate heuristic / method to solve the problem</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do / Carry out the Plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use computational skills ( +, -, &times; and &divide; ), geometrical skills and logical reasoning to carry out plan</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Check the Solution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check the reasonableness of the solution and answer</li>
<li>Improve / Change method used</li>
<li>Seek alternative solutions</li>
<li>Extend method to other problems</li>
</ul>
