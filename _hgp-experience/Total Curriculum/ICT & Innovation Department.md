<p>The ICT and Innovation Department is composed of staff from various departments supporting the school&rsquo;s ICT needs from teaching and learning with ICT to Cyber Wellness.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>&nbsp;: To develop each child to be a responsible cyber citizen and creative thinker</p>
<p>In alignment with MOE ICT Masterplan 4, we aim to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(1) Innovatively blend ICT usage into curriculum, pedagogy and assessment to provide holistic development of HGPians.<br />(2) Build the capacity of staff in the effective use of ICT tools through Professional Development Programs and mentoring.<br />(3) Tap on emerging technologies, both software and hardware to facilitate ICT-enriched lessons and striving towards organisational excellence.</p>
<p><strong>MOE Master Plan for ICT (MP4) Vision: Future-ready &amp; Responsible Digital Learners</strong></p>
<p>In alignment with our school mission and MP4 vision, we want to strengthen the 21st century competencies of our students. ICT is used to enable them to acquire critical thinking, civic literacy and ICT skills. The provision of interactive platforms such as the Student Learning System (SLS) will help our students be better engage and experience self-directed learning (SDL) and collaborative Learning (CoL).</p>
<p><strong>Computational Thinking via Coding 2015 and beyond </strong></p>
<p>We embarked on Code for Fun Enrichment Programme as post PSLE activity in 2015 to increase students&rsquo; exposure to coding and computational thinking. We leveraged on funding from IMDA for the conduct of training and purchase of educational kits. Many of the students were clearly interested in the programme and were observed to be very engaged during the lessons. This initiative is to equip our students with an essential skill for the future in alignment with Singapore&rsquo;s aim to become a Smart Nation of the future.</p>
<p>In 2016, we extended Code for Fun to our P5 and P6 students. In 2017, we tweaked the program to suit the needs of our Primary 1 and 2 students while continuing to equip our P5 and P6 students. In 2018, we introduced Code For Fun to all levels. A progressive plan for students&rsquo; training has been developed to make the teaching of Computational Thinking skills a structured one for the students. It will also be progressive in nature, whereby there will be three levels of training for students namely basic, intermediate and advanced. The aim of this innovative programme for our students is to equip them with a tool for problem-solving that is systematic, structured and rigorous.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning objectives of Computational Thinking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn important strategies for critical thinking, decision-making, designing projects and communication ideas.</li>
<li>Develop a creative and innovative mindset</li>
<li>Develop into confident speakers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Innovative Culture for Students</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the programme, students are given opportunities to be innovative and work with their peers. They will learn how to articulate their thoughts and compromise when there is a need to. They can learn to take responsibilities when decisions are made and become confident speakers when they present their projects to their teachers and peers. Students will be given tasks where they are encouraged to reflect and build on one another's ideas so that they can become more aware about themselves and learn to respect another person's opinion.</p>
