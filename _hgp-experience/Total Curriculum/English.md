<p><strong><u>Key Features</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>1) STELLAR Programme<br /></strong>The STELLAR Programme forms the basis of the school&rsquo;s English Language Curriculum. Stellar stands for Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading. The main aim of the STELLAR Programme is to strengthen students&rsquo; English Language and reading skills through the use of developmentally appropriate strategies such as the following:</p>

<li>Modified Language Experience Approach</li>
<li>Sustained Silent Reading</li>
<li>Supported Reading</li>
<li>Writing Process Cycle</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2) Read@HGP<br /></strong>Another key feature of the English Department is the Read@HGP initiative with its aim to nurture every child to become lifelong readers who are competent in both intensive and extensive reading. A team of English Department members work together to promote a positive reading culture in the school by providing a caring, conducive and inviting environment for reading. The team also collaborates with parents and other external organisations to develop the students&rsquo; love and passion for reading.</p>
