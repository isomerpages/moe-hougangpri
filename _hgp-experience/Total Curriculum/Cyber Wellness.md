<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness @ Hougang Primary</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Yearly Training for Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors<em><br></em></strong>Primary
4 to Primary 6 students who are selected as the Cyber Wellness Student
Ambassador (CWSA) of their class attend a training session where teachers
equip them with information on CW and share tips on how to advocate positive
online behaviours. Following that, the teachers meet up with the CWSAs
every term to pass them a poster with CW tips, which they will share with
their class during FTGP.</p>
<p><strong>Safer Internet Day Celebration<em><br></em></strong>Safer Internet
Day is celebrated in Hougang Primary every year with informative board
displays, interactive recess booths and an assembly programme. Besides
the CWSAs on duty to promote the event and man the booths, parent volunteers
are roped in to help out at the recess booths.</p>
