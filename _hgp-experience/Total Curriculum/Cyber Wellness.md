<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness @ Hougang Primary</strong></h4>
<p>Cyber Wellness @ Hougang Primary, or CW@HGP for short, aims to develop HGPians into responsible and respectful digital learners. Guided by MOE&rsquo;s Cyber Wellness Framework, there are various programmes planned and implemented to educate students in cyber wellness principles and anchor their well-being in cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>(a) Yearly Training for Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors<br /></em></strong>Primary 4 to Primary 6 students who are selected as the Cyber Wellness Student Ambassador (CWSA) of their class attend a training session where teachers equip them with information on CW and share tips on how to advocate positive online behaviours. Following that, the teachers meet up with the CWSAs every term to pass them a poster with CW tips, which they will share with their class during FTGP.</p>

<p><strong><em>(b) Safer Internet Day Celebration<br /></em></strong>Safer Internet Day is celebrated in Hougang Primary every year with informative board displays, interactive recess booths and an assembly programme. Besides the CWSAs on duty to promote the event and man the booths, parent volunteers are roped in to help out at the recess booths.</p>
