<p>At the core is the Future of Learning that is envisioned at HGP, underpinned
by Hope, Growth and Purpose.</p>
<p>We<em> </em>hope<em> </em>to design and enact a learner-centred curriculum
that provides our students with hope and confidence for the future, regardless
of their starting point in life.</p>
<p>We aim to provide educational experiences and learning spaces that support
the holistic growth of students and continual development of staff.</p>
<p>We want to create learning opportunities that encourage our students to
develop a sense of purpose beyond themselves and contribute to the world
around them.</p>
<p><strong>School Values</strong>
</p>
<p>The school values of Care, Integrity, Respect, Responsibility and Resilience
are transmitted via the total curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>Middle Ring</strong>
</p>
<p>The middle ring is divided into 2 domains : Curriculum and Co-Curriculum.</p>

<p>At HGP, we empahsize the holistic development of our students. Through
the school’s innovative curriculum and co-curriclum, HGP provides learning
experiences that will nurture our students in the cognitive, physical,
aesthetics, social-emotional and moral domains.</p>
<p>Our Teaching and Learning Framework draws on the PETALS dimensions (Pedagogy,
Experience of Learning, Tone of Environment, Assessment and Learning Content)
to guide teachers plan and design lessons that will engage our students
in their learning. We believe that when students are engaged, they will
be motivated to enhance their mastery of any subject independently and
will also be willing to take on new challenges/risks.</p>
<p><strong>Competencies and Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>With Social and Emotional Competencies, Innovation and ICT skills together
with knowledge acquired through curriculum and co-curriculum programmes,
HGPians would become a 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century independent learner,
which is closely aligned to MOE’s desired outcomes of education for every
student :</p>
