<h4><strong>Total Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>At Hougang Primary School (HGP), the total curriculum, ‘Future of Learning’
(FoL), refers to our students’ holistic educational experience in both
the academic and non-academic areas.</p>
<p>We hope to design and enact a learner-centred curriculum that provides
our students with hope and confidence for the future, regardless of their
starting point in life.</p>
<p>We aim to provide educational experiences and learning spaces that support
the holistic growth of students and continual development of staff.</p>
<p>We want to create learning opportunities that encourage our students to
develop a sense of purpose beyond themselves and contribute to the world
around them.</p>
<p>The total curriculum framework (diagram below) thus serves to guide the
planning and implementation of the total curriculum to meet the desired
student learning outcomes.</p>

<p>The framework is represented by a heart in the centre, surrounded by a
three-layered flywheel that symbolises how small, consistent efforts and
improvements in teaching and learning build on one another, then accumulate
over time to create a cycle of momentum. This momentum enables our students
to taste success, be it big or small, which in turn help the school achieve
the desired student outcomes.</p>
<p>The school values of <strong>Care, Integrity, Respect, Responsibility and Resilience</strong> lie
at the heart of the framework. They anchor our goal towards developing
our students holistically, shaping their beliefs, attitudes and actions.</p>
<p>The innermost ring of the flywheel encompasses the Emerging 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies (E21CCs). The school seeks to develop these competencies in
our students through the total curriculum, which will enable our students
to thrive in and beyond school while living, learning and working in a
rapidly changing, highly digitalised, and interconnected environment.</p>
<p>The middle ring of the flywheel entails the four broad components which
constitute a holistic and future-oriented education in HGP, providing our
students with rich and engaging learning experiences.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Engaging and innovative curriculum </strong>that
fosters curiosity, enhances critical thinking skills and promotes the joy
of learning.</p>
