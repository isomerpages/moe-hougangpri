<p><strong>Philosophy of Character and Citizenship Education</strong>
</p>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic
development of our students, equipping them with the competencies to thrive
in a future transformed by technology, to achieve the Desired Outcomes
of Education (DOEs). CCE at Hougang Primary School takes a student-centric
and integrated approach to meet our students’ learning needs, developing
them in values, character, social-emotional well-being and citizenship
dispositions in a coherent way.</p>
<p>We believe that every child can live out his or her potential and lead
a fulfilling life. To achieve this, we aim to help our students discover
their character strengths and interests, and provide them with the opportunities
to impact others positively through their contributions to the community.</p>
<p>Hougang Primary School’s CCE curriculum provides students with rich learning
platforms and opportunities to equip them with the knowledge, skills and
values to help them understand themselves better and to build positive
relationships with others. Equipped with the knowledge and skills, our
students will be able to contribute to the school and community through
intentionally designed learning experiences.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that the enactment of CCE should be done through partnership
with families and the community and therefore work with our stakeholders
in this.</p>

<p>To achieve our School’s Vision, Mission and Goals, the design and implementation
of the CCE curriculum is guided by the CCE Curriculum Frame (Fig. 1 below).</p>

<p>Through the CCE(FTGP) and CCE(MTL) curriculum, our teachers use age-appropriate
pedagogies to facilitate students’ learning experiences to develop their
social-emotional skills, which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions.</p>

<p>Beyond the classroom, our students are given opportunities to participate
in Key Student Development Experiences (e.g. National Education events
and Cohort Learning Journeys, Values-in-Action and CCA) to help them make
connections between the skills, values and competencies learnt in the classroom.</p>
