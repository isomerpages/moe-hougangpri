<h4><strong>To achieve the above desired outcomes, Hougang Primary School adopts</strong></h4>
<h4>HEART&nbsp;(HGPians&nbsp;Emphathise,&nbsp;Act &amp;&nbsp;Reach out&nbsp;Together) Initiatives</h4>
<h4><strong>Intergenerational Learning Programme (ILP)</strong></h4>
<p>Hougang Primary School is intensifying its efforts to reach out to the
elderly in the community as part of our Values In Action (VIA) programme.
In ILP, Primary 4 to 6 students will have the opportunity to interact and
engage&nbsp;with the elderly in the Senior Activity Centres. Through this
programme, our students can develop a sense of empathy, compassion and
respect towards our senior citizens.</p>
<h4><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong></h4>
<p>Through our VIA programme, our students will have the opportunity to interact
with students with Special Educational Needs (SEN), which in the process,
can develop&nbsp;students to&nbsp;be more understanding, accepting of the
differences and be more inclusive towards others.</p>
<h4><strong>National Education (NE) Programme</strong></h4>
<p><em>NE Commemorative Days</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Learning Journeys</em>&nbsp;seek
to develop Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross cultural Skills (CGC)
in our students so that they can be aware of national and global issues
and play a part to improve the community and nation whilst displaying socio-cultural
and religious sensitivity and awareness.</p>
