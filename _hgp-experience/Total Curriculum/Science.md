<p>The school&rsquo;s science curriculum adheres closely to the Primary Science Syllabus which is a foundation for scientific studies at higher levels.</p>
<p>This syllabus is based on the Science Curriculum Framework which emphasizes the need for a balance between the acquisition of science knowledge, process and attitudes. In addition, as and where the topics lend themselves, the technological applications, social implications and the value aspects of science are also considered. It also emphasizes the broad ranging fundamental concepts in the natural and physical world.</p>
<img style="width: 50%;" src="/images/sci.jpg">
<p>The above framework encapsulates the thrust of science education in Singapore to prepare our students to be sufficiently adept as effective citizens, able to function in and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven world.</p>
<p>The primary focus of the school&rsquo;s science curriculum is to inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry and this is carried out through the BSCS 5E Instructional Model.&nbsp;We hope that students view the pursuit of science as meaningful and useful, relating the roles played by science in daily life, society and the environment.</p>
<p>The content of the syllabus is organised into 5 themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity</li>
<li>Cycles</li>
<li>Systems</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Interactions</li>
</ul>
<p>The syllabus adopts the spiral approach. This is characterised by the revisiting of concepts and skills at different levels and with increasing depth. The spiral approach allows the learning of scientific concepts and skills to match studentsâ€Ÿ cognitive development. It therefore helps students build upon their existing understanding of concepts and facilitates the gradual mastery of skills.</p>
