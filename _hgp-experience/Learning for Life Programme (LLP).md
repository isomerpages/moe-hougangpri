<p><strong><u>2. Quality OE in PE Curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Hougang Primary School (HGP) has a comprehensive and structured programme
to provide every HGPian with a multi-disciplinary and varied experience
of Outdoor Education (OE) that suits the ability of each child.&nbsp;Over
the six years of education in HGP, students spend an average of about 20
hours per year on OE experiences. The OE in PE curriculum and P1/P2 PAL
OE&nbsp;provide the foundation for every HGPian from P1 to P6. Students
develop appropriate outdoor skills through physical activities while cultivating
an attitude of care and appreciation for the environment, and thoughtful
consideration of the risks and safety of self and others. The OE in PE
curriculum is supplemented by the OE curriculum that the school has crafted
to enhance the learning experience.&nbsp;Besides equipping the students
with outdoor skills, knowledge and experience, the main focus of OE is
to imbue in every child good character values and leadership skills that
will serve them well for the future and helps them make the right decisions.</p>
<p><strong><u>3. Signature OE Programme for Every Level</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Level-wide programmes are planned for mass participation so that every
student, from P1 to P6, is given the opportunity for&nbsp;exposure and
to ignite their interest. The P4 to P6 OE Enrichment Programme, P4 Sustainability
and the Environment Programme, P5 Outdoor Education Camp and P6 Kayaking
Expedition are some of the examples that provides students with the skills,
motivation and encouragement towards life-long participation in such healthy
activities.</p>
<p>To augment the level-wide programmes, students with specific interests,
skills and talents are given the opportunity to develop further through
specific programmes, such as overseas learning journeys and sport climbing
competitions. Please see the table below for the description of some of
these programmes.&nbsp;</p>
