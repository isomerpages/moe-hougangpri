<p><strong><em><u>Introduction<br /></u></em></strong>The Tamil Department was formed in the year 2001, when the school started functioning at its new ground. In the first year, the Tamil pupils cohort consisted of just 21 Tamil pupils in Primary 1, and the department was led by 1 Tamil teacher. Over the years, we have grown from strength to strength. Today, we are heartened to have 115 Tamil pupils and</p>
<p>3 dedicated Tamil teachers in Hougang Primary.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Objectives of the department<br /></u></em></strong>The Tamil Department of Hougang Primary School aims at developing in our students the passion and appreciation of learning Tamil language, culture and arts, by enhancing the teaching and learning of Tamil Language and providing quality Tamil education.&nbsp;In line with our school philosophy- Bringing out the Best in Every Child, Together- the Tamil Department has been assuming interesting and engaging initiatives to cultivate and sustain in students the interest of learning Tamil Language, and uncovering their potential. This is done via a variety of programmes.</p>
