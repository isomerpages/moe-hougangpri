<p><strong>Citi-Ideas in Action</strong></p>
<img style="width: 85%;" src="/images/2006a.png" />
<p>Our Life Sciences Ambassadors presented their idea of creating a Butterfly Garden at our school at the Citibank Ideas in Action. The judges were very impressed and awarded them $2500 to carry out their project. The students had to find specific plants to attract the butterflies. They got help from the Nature Society who gave them a list of plants to get. Some of these plants were not available in nurseries and the students got the seeds from the Butterfly Garden in Pulau Ubin as the school had contacts with a National Parks officer there. The plants in the Butterfly Garden took 6 moths to grow to what it is today. 16 species of butterflies have been spotted so far including the rare Plain Tiger Butterfly.</p>

<p>In 2006 the Life Science Ambassadors carried out a project to solve the growing pest problem in our Eco-garden. They made eco-friendly pesticides made of garlic, chili, and ginger and stopped the contractor from spraying commercial pesticides. They learnt that the commercial pesticides burnt the leaves of the plants during hot weather and killed the beneficial insects that preyed on these pests. Their project earned the school the Gold Award for the third time in this competition</p>

<p>With the help of the teachers, our Life Science Ambassadors created a Life Science Website for the school. You can virtually travel to any areas in X-Cell Zone using the website. You are looking at the website right now!</p>
