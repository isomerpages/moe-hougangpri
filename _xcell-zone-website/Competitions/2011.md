<p><strong>10th Elementz Science Project Competition and Exhibition (Gold Award)</strong></p>
<p>A group of Science Ambassadors embarked on an investigative project on the best water-tank design for HDB flats. In line with the theme of &lsquo;Making A Difference&rsquo;, the objective of the project aims to harness the natural heat and light energy from the Sun to heat up water for homes. This will reduce electrical bill and our dependency on unsustainable fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The results showed that a black-coloured water tank placed in a greenhouse with mirrors surrounding it to reflect more light, heats up the water more effectively.</p>
<p>The team hopes to recommend this water-tank design to HDB and encourage HDB to build a greenhouse water tank with mirrors in every HDB building. The cost of building and maintenance is very low and it can save a lot of electricity and most importantly, it saves Mother Earth!</p>

<p><strong>Greenwave Environmental Competition 2011 (1st Prize $4000)</strong></p>
<p>Our Life Science Ambassadors wanted to create a vertical garden in our school. Almost all the places in our garden have been taken up by plants over the years. They were thinking of other ways in which they could grow plants in the limited space that the school has. A vertical garden seemed to be the most practical idea but they did not want what was available commercially as they thought they were too bulky and hard to maintain. They wanted a design not found in Singapore that could be installed manually by any budding gardener, and even at a HDB balcony.</p>
<p>They worked with the system that was created by Patrick Blanc a botanist and inventor of &ldquo;the green wall&rdquo;. After experimenting with a prototype, they created a 55 square metre vertical garden. All the plants were planted by our Life Science Ambassadors.</p>
