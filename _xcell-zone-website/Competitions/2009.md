<p><strong>Green Wave Environmental Care Project (1ST Prize) $4000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Podcasting at X-Cell Zone</strong></p>
<p>In 2009 the Life Science Ambassadors created a podcast of the various areas in the school. They did this with the help of their teacher who gave them the information. The pupils took the pictures and did the recording.<br />They also helped create the check points for the various areas so that students would be able to go to these areas and listen to the podcast accordingly. The school also had various charts on animals and plants which the Ambassadors wanted to install in the garden. The information on these charts is relevant to the area that they are at. Putting these in place helped make the garden more conducive for learning.</p>

<p><strong>Transitional Windscreen (Silver Award)</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever seen your parents struggle to put on their sunglasses while driving? A group of our school&rsquo;s Science Ambassadors have and so they embarked on a study to find out the feasibility of replacing existing car windscreen glass with glass covered with photochromic material. Using data loggers attached with light sensor, they were able to find out the effectiveness of photochromic material in blocking out visible light compared to the material used in car windscreen.</p>
