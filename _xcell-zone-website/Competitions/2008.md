<p><strong>Green Wave Environmental Care Project</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eco-Friendly Eco-Garden (Merit Award) $500</strong></p>
<p>The Water recycling plant was completed in October 2007. But the Life Science Ambasadors had only completed half of what they had planned.</p>
<p>In 2008 they came up with the idea to build solar panels to power the sprinkler timers. Their idea would make the garden eco-friendly as the plants are watered from the rain water collected by the water recycling plant and this water is delivered to the plants by a sprinkler system that is solar powered</p>

<p><strong>Solar Powered Battery Charger (Gold award)</strong></p>
<p>In 2008, the school&rsquo;s Science Ambassadors showcased their project titled &ldquo;Solar Powered Battery Charger&rdquo; at the Elementz Science Project Competition and Exhibition. The project investigates how solar energy can be used as a clean energy source. From their findings, the pupils developed a mobile phone charger that harnesses the Sun&rsquo;s energy and converts it to electrical energy to enable the charging of mobile phone batteries.</p>
