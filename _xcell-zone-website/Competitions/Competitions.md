<p>Our Life Science Ambassadors are a special group of pupils who render their services at our Centre for Life Sciences, X-Cell Zone. Since the launch of the Centre in 2002, these ambassadors have been taking care of the premises and animals, involved in the improvement of the various areas in X-Cell Zone and representing the school in several research projects and competitions in the area of Science. With their passion and commitment in the projects they undertake, they made the school proud by clinching several prestigious awards in competitions.</p>
<p>In their pursuit of excellence, these ambassadors displayed their flair in innovative thinking, creative conceptualizing and entrepreneurship. They exhibited outstanding oral and communication skills as they articulate their projects to a panel of judges. They were put to the test to think on their feet during the question and answer sessions and this exposure has helped to develop their thinking skills.</p>
<p>In achieving our mission to instill in each pupil a passion for Science through active learning, the Science Department will continue to ensure that our pupils have the opportunities to be involved in research projects and competitions so as to further inspire them to become future researchers and scientists.Our Life Science Ambassadors are a special group of pupils who render their services at our Centre for Life Sciences, X-Cell Zone.
