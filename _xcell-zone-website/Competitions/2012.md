<p><strong>10th Elementz Science Project Competition and Exhibition<br /></strong><strong>Project: Crash No More<br /></strong><strong>P5/P6 category (P5 team) Gold award</strong></p>
<p>Four Primary five Science enthusiasts adopted an investigative approach to find out if the impact of a car crash can be reduced. This project kindled their interest when they read about the Ferrari car crash which took a life. They wanted to prove that the impact of car collision can be reduced with the use of magnets which centralises on the concept of unlike poles of magnets repel.</p>
<p>They fixed magnets on the front and back of two battery-operated cars before letting them collide numerous times. They used data-logger and sound sensor to measure the amount of sound produced during the collisions and plasticine to measure the amount of indentation upon collision. Upon comparison with the control set-up, the group was elated to found that magnets do help to reduce impact upon collision of two cars. They hope that cars could be fixed with magnets which can be turn on and off in order to reduce the impact of a car crash so that a life can be saved.</p>

<p><strong>10th Elementz Science Project Competition and Exhibition<br /></strong><strong>Project: Freshy Business<br /></strong><strong>P3/P4 category(P3 team) Silver award</strong></p>
<p>A group of four enthusiastic Primary three pupils took up the challenge to investigate how fruits like apples and pears can be kept as fresh as possible without refrigeration in tropical climate. This experiment idea came about when fruits taken along for overseas expeditions and local camps turned bad quickly under hot and humid conditions.</p>
<p>The pupils used different materials (cling wrap, newspapers, aluminium foil and Ziploc bag) to test how they affect the freshness of an apple. This investigative approach has allowed them to conclude that the best material for maintaining the freshness of fruits during is the Ziploc bag. So now, Ziploc bag is one of the must-buy items in the department&rsquo;s camping list</p>
