<p><strong>Science Fair</strong></p>
<p>Four pupils who are pro-environmentalists took on an investigative project on the absorbency of three biodegradable sponges. They explored the usage of the most absorbent sponge in removing stagnant water in vases, flower pots and overlays of plant leaves.</p>
<p>Through this project, they have learnt a lot on the scientific method and the importance of conducting a fair test as well as ensuring the accuracy of their results. This experience has made their learning of Science more meaningful.</p>
