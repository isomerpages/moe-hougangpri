<p><strong>Citi-Ideas in Action</strong></p>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/2007a.jpg" />
<p>A group of Life Science Ambassadors got a little ambitious and presented two projects at the Citibank Ideas In Action in 2007. Both projects were awarded grants. We were very proud of them as only 101 projects out of over 500 submitted were awarded grants. $1500 and $2500 grant for the fruit orchard and the water recycling plant respectively.</p>
<p>The Fruit orchard was created as the students felt that many of the fruit trees within X-Cell Zone did not bear fruit because of the lack of sunlight. The trees which were planted at a new location are still young and our Ambassadors hope to see the fruit of their labour in a few years time.</p>
<p>The idea of the water recycling plant crept into our student&rsquo;s minds when they saw water gushing out of our drainage pipes during rainy days. The plant now provides water supply to our automatic sprinkler system in the Eco-garden. Water is an important commodity in Singapore and our Ambassadors want to use this Water Recycling Plant to teach pupils the importance of saving water.</p>

<p>Our Life Science Ambassadors researched on how, they can speed up the decomposition of organic materials so that they can obtain compost at a faster rate. This was a follow up of the Compost Power project in 2005. They achieved the Bronze award for their project.</p>
