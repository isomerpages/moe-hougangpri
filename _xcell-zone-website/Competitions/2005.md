<p><strong>Science Fair- Project selected for exhibition at the Science Centre</strong></p>
<p>After embarking on the project of using hydroponics nutrient solution to make water plants healthier, the life Science Ambassadors did further research to find out how the nutrient solution would affect the fishes in the pond. Experiments were carried out with guppies to find out which levels of nutrient solution would be toxic to fishes. This was to ensure that we never use too much of it to fertilize the water plants</p>

<p>In 2005 the Science Ambassadors did a project using compost from our leave litter corner. They set out to prove that the compost yielded better growing plants than plants grown with commercial compost and fertilizers. The compost that they made was used to grow healthier plants in Hougang Primary School &rsquo;s very own plant nursery.</p>
