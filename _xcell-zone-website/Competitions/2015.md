<p><strong>13th Elementz Science Project Competition and Exhibition</strong></p>
<p><strong>How Cool? P3/P4 category<br /></strong><strong>(Gold Award)</strong></p>
<p>Our school has five different colours for our PE uniform. Each colour, purple, green, yellow, blue and red represent the different houses in our school. Some years ago we changed our cotton PE uniforms to dry fit material. Some students were curious to know which uniform colour and material can keep them the coolest as they perform many outdoor activities in their PE uniform. Their results will surprise you! it could be the reason why red house has been winning for so many years.</p>
