<p><strong>North Zone 9th Elementz Science Research Competition (Innovation and Enterprise Category) Gold Award Winners</strong></p>
<p>Our Life Science Ambassadors went to several schools to study the water samples in their school pond. They concluded that the water plants growing in the pond were not healthy because of the low nutrient levels in the water. They came up with the idea of using the nutrient water from our hydroponics facility to help increase the nutrient level in the school pond. Small amounts of it did not kill the fishes. The results were stunning. The water plants that are growing in the school pond are very healthy now. For their project, they were the only team that got the Gold Award for their category in the Elementz Science Competition.</p>
