<p>There are 20 over species of ferns in our Fernery at X-Cell Zone. We have still not identified the names of someof them. We are always looking for new species to add to our Fernery. There are also other plants at our Fernery co-existing with the ferns as they do in nature. We have a netting over our fernery to replicate a shaded rainforest environment. We also have automatic sprinklers as ferns like moist and humid conditions. That does not mean that all ferns like these conditions. Some ferns like a lot of sunlight and some can do well in dry conditions. Some are known to us as water plants eg. water moss fern, mosquito fern and horsetail which you can find at our Eco-pond.</p>
<p>Ferns are non-flowering plants and they reproduce from spores. There are about 20 000 fern species worldwide. 350 million years ago the earth was dominated by the ancestors of the present day ferns and fern allies. Some grew as much as 40 metres high. When the world's climate changed, these large ferns rotted to become coal.</p>
