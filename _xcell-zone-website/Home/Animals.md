<p><strong>Pest<br /></strong>We have many pests in the garden. Getting rid of them can sometimes be an impossible task. Most of these pasts are sucking pests. They are small and sometimes difficult to detect. These pest feed on plant juices and make the leaves turn yellow, wilt or deformed.There are other pest but those have been put under the Animals section. Those under the animals sections are mainly chewers. They eat the leaves of plants and are usually easier to get rid off.</p>
