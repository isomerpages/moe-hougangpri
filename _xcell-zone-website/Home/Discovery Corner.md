<p><strong>Mushroom Farm<br /></strong>Our Mushroom Farm shows our students how Fungi grows. The Mushrooms are edible and we usually grow King Oyster Mushroom which the students form the Life Science Club harvest and sell. They are very popular and are usually sold out in minutes!</p>

<p>Our students get to see different species of butterflies undergo metamorphosis throughout the year. Students from our Life Science Club will add caterpillars that they find from our Butterfly Garden to add to the enclosure. Releasing the butterflies after metamorphosis is always a treat!</p>
