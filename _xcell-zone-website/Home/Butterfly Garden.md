<p>Our Life Sciences Ambassadors presented their idea of creating a Butterfly Garden at our school at the Citib-Ideas in Action in 2006. The judges were very impressed and awarded them $ 2500 to carry out their project. The students had to find specific plants to attract the butterflies. They got help from the Nature Society who gave them a list of plants to get. Some of these plants were not available in nurseries and the students got the seeds from the Butterfly Garden in Pulau Ubin as the school had contacts with a National Parks officer there. The plants in the Butterfly Garden took 6 moths to grow to what it is today. 15 species of butterflies have been spotted so far including the rare Plain Tiger Butterfly.</p>
