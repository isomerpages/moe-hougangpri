<p>Here are some of the fungi that we happen to find in our Eco-garden. You can usually find them when the weather is wet. Most fungi grow and multiply rapidly under warm and moist conditions. It is believed that there is about 100 000 to 250 000 species of fungi. They are not plants as they don't make their own food. They grow on living or dead organism and absorb nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Fungi can be found all over the world. They are found in the soil, in water, on decaying or living things, in homes and even in the air we breathe. Some fungi are safe to eat and are used in many of our delicacies, some however are poisonous. Fungi can be both useful and harmful.</p>

<p>Our Leaf Litter and Rotting Log Corner is for students to observe the Animal Life living in it. The glass panel was purposely designed so that animal life can be observed within the leaf litter. The rotting log is home to many animals like the millipede seen in the bottom left picture. Fungus can also be seen growing on the logs. They act as decomposers and help break down the rotting log. Every year the compost from the bottom of the leaf litter is removed and used to fertilise the plants in the Eco-garden.</p>
