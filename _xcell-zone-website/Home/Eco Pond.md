<p>Our Eco-Pond is home to over 35 species of water plants. The plants that you see on this site are the only ones that we are able to identify so far. Some of the water plants are found in the nursey and not in the Eco-pond as they are unable to co-exists with the other plants.<br />The pond offers an opportunity for exciting discoveries with its rich diversity of animals and plants. The animals that can be found at the pond can be seen in our 'Animals' section</p>

<p><strong>Water Hyacinth<br /></strong>Water Hyacinth is a floating plant with swollen leaf stalks. The leaf stalks contain air and help the pant to float in the water. It has waxy leaves and light purple flowers that grow in a cluster.</p>

<p>This floating plant has leaves arranged like a lettuce. It has small white flowers that are rarely seen. It floats on the water with only its long roots in the water. It is very common in ponds and lakes. Stolons produced by the plant bear daughter plants so that with subsequen stolon production, a 'string' of connected plants ultimately forms.</p>
<p>Medicinal value: This plant was used by the Chinese to increase menstrual flow. It was also applied externally to treat skin problems.</p>
