<p>The X-Cell Zone is conceptualised to provide an environment conducive to the learning of Science. It encompasses the Eco-Garden, Discovery Corner and Life Science Laboratory.</p>
<p>We are pleased that our pupils and teachers benefit through the various programmes offered. The life science programmes not only broadens and deepens pupils&rsquo; content knowledge, but also widens their imagination and innate curiosity. The pupils&rsquo; leadership skills are honed through the Life Science Ambassador roles undertaken and they are also exposed to a variety of competitions offered. Teachers benefit through the various pedagogical training courses organized.</p>
<p>X-Cell Zone thus serves as a springboard for our students and teachers to spur an enduring interest in Life Sciences.</p>
<p>Through the setting up of the X-Cell Zone, HGP hopes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>cultivate our students' passion for Life Sciences</li>
<li>develop in students a sense of inquiry in their quest for scientific knowledge</li>
<li>provide more independent learning experiences for the students, encouraging them to explore</li>
</ul>
