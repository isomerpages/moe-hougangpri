<p dir="ltr">Media Resource Library (MRL) aims to promote the love for reading among our students and provide them the opportunities to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to access library resources and the world. To enhance the Joy of Learning, the children are also introduced to different themes and genre of books. To promote good reading habits, the students help to conduct assembly talk and act as a library ambassador. Through team work, the students are being inculcated the four school values (Care, Integrity, Resilience and Responsibility). MRL equips students with lifelong learning skills and develops the imagination, enabling them to live as responsible citizens.</p>
