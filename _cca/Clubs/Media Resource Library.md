<p>Media Resource Library (MRL) aims to promote the love for reading among
our students and provide them the opportunities to develop the knowledge
and skills necessary to access library resources and the world. To enhance
the Joy of Learning, the children are also introduced to different themes
and genre of books. To promote good reading habits, the students help to
conduct assembly talk and act as a library ambassador. Through team work,
the students are being inculcated the four school values (Care, Integrity,
Resilience and Responsibility). MRL equips students with lifelong learning
skills and develops the imagination, enabling them to live as responsible
citizens.</p>
