<p>The Infocomm Club CCA aims to excite students about infocomm in a fun
and meaningful way by helping them to learn new infocomm skills and to
cultivate computational thinking at an early age. Through the clubâ€™s activities,
students will better appreciate technology and learn about robotics. The
students will be equipped with relevant skills like block-based programming.
At the same time, they will be imbued with values of care and resilience
when they help one another to debug codes and find errors in the scripts.
Applying what they have learnt and under the guidance of the ICT trainers,
the students will work collaboratively and take on projects such as game
creation, designing flight paths for drones and building useful smart devices.</p>
