<p dir="ltr">The Photography Club CCA aims to allow students to express their creativity through the use of photographs, both printed and digital. This CCA caters to students who are keen to learn and explore the use of digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras to capture photographs. Students are given opportunities to practice with actual DSLR cameras to further develop their skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students are also introduced to photography basics such as Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO, the Rule of Thirds and other tools to help them achieve better photographs. They then practice and apply these rules and skills during their duties of taking photographs during school events. They are given opportunities to represent the school in inter-school photography competitions such as Photofest and Shutterbug, where they will go for outdoor shoots and test their skills with photographers from other schools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students are imbued with all the school values of Care, Integrity, Resilience, and Responsibility as they carry out their duties, while handling professional equipment.</p>
