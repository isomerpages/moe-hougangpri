<p>The Photography Club CCA aims to allow students to express their creativity
through the use of photographs, both printed and digital. This CCA caters
to students who are keen to learn and explore the use of digital single-lens
reflex (DSLR) cameras to capture photographs. Students are given opportunities
to practice with actual DSLR cameras to further develop their skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students are also introduced to photography basics such as Aperture, Shutter
Speed, ISO, the Rule of Thirds and other tools to help them achieve better
photographs. They then practice and apply these rules and skills during
their duties of taking photographs during school events. They are given
opportunities to represent the school in inter-school photography competitions
such as Photofest and Shutterbug, where they will go for outdoor shoots
and test their skills with photographers from other schools.</p>
<p>Students are imbued with all the school values of Care, Integrity, Resilience,
and Responsibility as they carry out their duties, while handling professional
equipment.</p>
