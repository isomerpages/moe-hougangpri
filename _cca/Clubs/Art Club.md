<p><strong>Misson: To Inspire and Arouse Interest in&nbsp;Arts&nbsp;&amp; Craft</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vision: </strong><strong>Passionate young artist&nbsp;with a heart for the community</strong></p>
<p>The Art&nbsp;Club&nbsp;aims to inspire learning through&nbsp;arts&nbsp;and enhance passion for&nbsp;art. <br />Students will have opportunities to&nbsp;experience various&nbsp;art&nbsp;forms and at the same time, discover their strengths and interests. They will be working with mixed media such as clay, viable wires, plasters and canvases etc. which builds on the students&rsquo; problem-solving skills, fine motor skills and social skills as they work with the diverse artistic media.</p>
<p><strong>Motto: Aspire, Realisation &amp; Teamwork.</strong></p>
