<p><strong>Indian dance</strong>&nbsp;forms in Singapore include bharatanatyam, kathakali, kathak, manipuri, kuchipudi and odissi, amongst others. The&nbsp;<strong>dance</strong>&nbsp;forms involve specific gestures, expressions, steps and postures rooted in the traditions from the various regions in&nbsp;<strong>India</strong>.</p>
<p>In Hougang Primary School we introduce these different forms of Indian dances to our students. These dances are performed during School and Community events.</p>
