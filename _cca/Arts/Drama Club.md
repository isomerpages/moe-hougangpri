<p>The Drama Club CCA aims to develop students who are creative, confident,
and expressive in their performances. Students will be developed in their
oral communication, literacy &amp; collaborative skills. Opportunities
will be given to them to perform at various platforms and appreciate theatrical
performances by attending workshops and plays organised by external agencies
such as SOTA and ACT3.</p>
<p>Students will be exposed to theatre techniques and learn to express themselves
confidently. They will also get the chance to experience the excitement
and rewards of theatre arts while developing poise, social skills, confidence
and the ability to work with others.</p>
