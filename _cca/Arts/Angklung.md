<p>The Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble CCA aims to develop and enhance our students&rsquo; potential holistically.&nbsp; Having a musical background is not a prerequisite.&nbsp; Students will gain exposure through the opportunities provided to represent the school in community performances and the Singapore Youth Festival.&nbsp; While students take part in these events, we hope to develop their leadership skills and nurture good values in them.&nbsp; All HGPians Excel with Character!</p>
