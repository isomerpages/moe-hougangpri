<p>The Brass Band CCA aims to develop the students’ interest in and appreciation
of music. Having musical background is not a pre-requisite for joining
the Brass Band. Students have opportunities to explore different musical
instruments such as the cornet, horn, tuba, euphonium, trombone and percussion
instruments. During practice sessions, they also learn basic handling and
maintenance of instruments allocated to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Brass Band members are given the platform to perform in a myriad
of school and community events as well as the Singapore Youth Festival.
By exposing them to these events, we aim to develop in them leadership
skills and important character values like teamwork, care, integrity, responsibility
and resilience. These attributes will enable them to adapt to their constantly
evolving environment with greater confidence.</p>
