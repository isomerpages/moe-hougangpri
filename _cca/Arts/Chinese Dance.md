<p>Chinese Dance encourage students to pursue and excel in performing arts.
We aim for students to try their best in every dance and at the same time
enhance the joy of learning. Participating in SYFs and performances during
school events, such as Chinese New Year celebrations not only allow students
to showcase their talents to the rest of the school, but also expose students
to the rich cultural art form of Chinese Dance. The trainings also incorporates
traditional and contemporary forms of Chinese Dance, to allow students
to expand their repertoire.</p>
<p>We hope to develop in our students the schoolâ€™s values (Care, Integrity,
Resilience and Responsibility), as well as acquire positive values like
perseverance, commitment and team spirit. We believe that passion and hard
work will help the student to go far in her journey in this art.&nbsp;</p>
