<p>Chinese Dance encourage students to pursue and excel in performing arts. We aim for students to try their best in every dance and at the same time enhance the joy of learning. Participating in SYFs and performances during school events, such as Chinese New Year celebrations not only allow students to showcase their talents to the rest of the school, but also expose students to the rich cultural art form of Chinese Dance. The trainings also incorporates traditional and contemporary forms of Chinese Dance, to allow students to expand their repertoire.</p>
<p>We hope to develop in our students the school&rsquo;s values (Care, Integrity, Resilience and Responsibility), as well as acquire positive values like perseverance, commitment and team spirit. We believe that passion and hard work will help the student to go far in her journey in this art.&nbsp;</p>
