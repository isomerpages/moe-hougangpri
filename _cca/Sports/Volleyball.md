<p>Team HGP Volleyball aims to promote the sport and personal excellence
for each athlete and a lifelong love of the game in a caring, respectful
and supportive environment. It also provides our athletes a culture that
inspires, educates, and develops future leaders.&nbsp;Volleyball is a team
sport that requires good communication between players, hand – eye coordination,
agility, speed and flexibility. Under the introduction of a talent identification
program, Primary 1 and 2 students are shortlisted by their PE teachers
followed by a second round of selection by the volleyball coach. They will
then train once a week. At Primary 3, they will undergo another set of
selection by the coach to join the school team. In Team HGP Volleyball,
we believe that everyone is important and therefore on top of the National
School Games, students who are not selected for school teams will get to
compete in the soft volleyball carnival. We also have intra-school HGP
Volleyball Championships annually where students form teams and compete
with each other. In addition to that, the school teams will be exposed
to friendly matches against other schools to get more game experience in
preparation for National School Games. For the Primary 5 students, they
get to play with Secondary 1 volleyball teams from various schools. With
that, they can improve their skills, learn from their seniors and also
find out how Volleyball is like in secondary schools. Lastly, we have alumni
who have graduated from HGP and they contribute by coming back and help
coach our juniors too! We aim to cultivate an interest in this exciting
and powerful team sport. Weekly training not only focuses on fundamental
skills, fitness conditioning and game play, it also emphasises discipline
and team building. We firmly believe that participating in a team sport
like Volleyball will help to impart the necessary values required to shape
one’s character.</p>
