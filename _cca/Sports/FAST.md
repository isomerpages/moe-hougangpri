<p>Fun, Active and Supportive Team (F.A.S.T Club) aims to promote health
and fitness among students to help them lead an active and healthy lifestyle.
This CCA caters to students who are keen to learn and explore a multiplicity
of sports instead of specialising in one specific sport. To enhance the
Joy of Learning, the children are also introduced to other sports and games
that are less common such as Tchoukball and Touch Rugby. They also have
opportunities to represent the school in competitions and attend termly
outings that expose them to activities outside PE curriculum. Students
are imbued with all the four school values (Care, Integrity, Resilience
and Responsibility) as they work in teams taking care of one another, playing
fair and persevere in challenging times. As the saying goes, ‘Tough times
do not last. Tough HGPians do!’</p>
