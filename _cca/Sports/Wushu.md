<p>Wushu CCA aims to develop each child to be a self-directed learner who
questions, reflects, perseveres and takes responsibility for his/her own
learning.&nbsp; Students will seek improvement during the practice, together
with the rest in the group. They will have opportunities to perform during
Chinese New Year celebration in school or represent school for Interschool
Wushu Championship. Each student will self-assess the quality of his/her
own performance for an event in relation to the rest of the group members
and aspires to be an active contributor who is innovative, exercises initiative
and strives for excellence in all the four school values - Care, Integrity,
Respect, Resilience and Responsibility.</p>
