<p>Wushu CCA aims to develop each child to be a self-directed learner who questions, reflects, perseveres and takes responsibility for his/her own learning.&nbsp; Students will seek improvement during the practice, together with the rest in the group. They will have opportunities to perform during Chinese New Year celebration in school or represent school for Interschool Wushu Championship. Each student will self-assess the quality of his/her own performance for an event in relation to the rest of the group members and aspires to be an active contributor who is innovative, exercises initiative and strives for excellence in all the four school values - Care, Integrity, Resilience and Responsibility.</p>
