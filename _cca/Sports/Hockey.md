<p>Team HGP Hockey CCA focuses on four main elements including knowledge, fitness, skills and attitude. The CCA focuses on character building and aims to cultivate a sense of appreciation and love for Hockey, and sports in general, as they contribute towards a vibrant sporting culture in the school. Every member is given an opportunity to display their enthusiasm and love for the sport through the training sessions, friendly matches and competitions. Game concepts and tactics will be taught to enhance their confidence and skills while fostering team spirit.</p>
<p>Over the years, HGP Hockey participated fervently in national competitions. Our training enhances student&rsquo;s confidence, hockey skills, self-esteem and bring forth opportunities to bring out the best of all our members. While strengthening their individual capacity and team spirit, we hope the sessions will also improve their ability to make sound decisions in both academic and non-academic areas.</p>
<p>Grow as individuals, Work as a TEAM!</p>
