<p>Sport Climbing is a great sport in the form of rock climbing that relies on anchors fixed to our climbing structure and wall, both indoors and outdoors.&nbsp; It builds and maintains both fitness and mental strength. In fact, it is one of the best sports to develop your child&rsquo;s psychomotor, cognitive as well as affective skills. Through Sport Climbing, students will become more confident and resilient individuals. They learn the various climbing skills and techniques, particularly in the form of top rope and bouldering, from our coaches in their challenge to climb the tough walls. This sport also builds up values such as compassion and responsibility as our students also take up belaying duties where they need to be the anchors for the climbers and help guide their friends who are climbing the route. In the process, they learn about skills on communication and teamwork and all these are aligned to our school core values of Care, Integrity, Resilience and Responsibility.</p>
