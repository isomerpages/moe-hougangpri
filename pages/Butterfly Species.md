<p>We have so far spotted 18 species of butterflies at our garden. We have successfully been able to capture all of them on camera. We try to take the best pictures we can but some of the butterflies never seem to want to stay still. Check out the butterflies that we have spotted in Hougang Primary!</p>

<p><strong>Chocolate Pansy / Junonia hedonia ida<br /></strong>This common butterfly can be easily spotted in any forest clearing. It is a sun-loving butterfly that likes to dart after passing butterflies. In Hougang Primary it is commonly found in the Butterfly Garden or near the Eco-pond area.</p>

<p><strong>Plain Tiger / Danaus chrysippus chrysippus<br /></strong>We are fortunate to be able to take pictures of all 3 stages of the Plain Tiger butterfly at our garden. The beautiful caterpillars like to feast on our Calotropis plants. This butterfly which used to be fairly common is now a rare sight in Singapore. It is very beautiful, graceful and slow-flying.</p>
