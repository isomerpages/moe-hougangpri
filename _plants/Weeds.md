<p>These plants are usually small in size and grow wild in open spaces. They are called weeds because they appear in places where they are not supposed to be and sometimes cause a nuisance as they steal nutrients from plants that were intended to be there. Surprisingly many of these weeds are used as herbs and medicine.</p>
