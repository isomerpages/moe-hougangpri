</p>
<p>Hougang Primary School (HGP) celebrated its 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary
in 2020. Founded in 2000 with an enrolment of around 600 students and a
modest staff size of 20, the school has grown from strength to strength
to its present enrolment of 1305 and staff strength of 106 under the leadership
of its former principals Mr Goh Ek Piang (2000 to 2007), Mrs Sabrina James
(2007 to 2014) and Mdm Rashidah Bte Abdul Rasip (2014 to 2020). Mr Jason
Goh currently serves as its fourth principal, taking over the school leadership
on 1 Jan 2021.</p>
<p>Over the years, HGP has remained a school of choice for parents, especially
in the neighbouring estates of Hougang, Serangoon, Seng Kang and Ang Mo
Kio. During the annual Primary 1 Registration Exercises, vacancies are
typically filled up by Phase 2C, with balloting required in the latter
phase. To a large extent, HGP’s relative popularity among prospective parents
stems from its following niche areas that have also given the school a
distinctive identity and brand:</p>
<p><u>a. Outdoor Adventure Education (OAE)<br></u>As the school’s Learning
for Life Programme (LLP), OAE provides HGP-ians with authentic, hands-on
and physical learning experiences aimed at instilling values and developing
character. Through a structured and progressive OAE curriculum that entails
orienteering, camp craft, bouldering, abseiling and caving, HGP-ians are
given the opportunity to embrace challenges and overcome obstacles, both
confidently and competently. Furthermore, as many of the learning experiences
involve students working collaboratively with their peers, OAE also serves
as an important lever to facilitate social mixing, promoting a culture
of inclusivity within the school community.</p>
<p><u>b. Science Education<br></u>The school's Applied Learning Programme
(ALP) in Science Education aims to cultivate a spirit of inquiry in HGP-ians,
by allowing them to explore and experience the impact of Science on the
real world. Anchored on environmental education, the ALP drives the school’s
efforts and achievements in the areas of bio-diversity and eco-sustainability.
With its campus immersed in rich flora and fauna, HGP was designated by
NParks as a Centre for Biodiversity for Schools in the North East. In Feb
2020, we also received the BCA Green Mark Goldplus certificate, recognising
the school as a green building and affirming its efforts in reducing energy
consumption through the pervasive use of energy-efficient technology. In
Oct 2021, the school achieved the Diamond Award, Platinum Banding and “Outstanding
Environmentally Friendly, Biodiversity Community Garden” Ribbon under the
Community in Bloom Programme organized by NParks Singapore.</p>
