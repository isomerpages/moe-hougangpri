_“Study what you love, and you’ll never have to work a day in your life. It’ll be one great adventure.” – David Gerrold_

**\*\*\***

**Learning What We Love, Loving What We Learn**

Happy New Year to all! To our new P1 students, a warm welcome to the Hougang Primary (HGP) family. Like your seniors in the school, I am confident that your six years with us will be one great adventure filled with meaningful, memorable and magical experiences!

At HGP, we strive to develop our students into future-ready thinkers with a heart for others. With a rapidly evolving future unfolding before us, it will never be sufficient to acquire all the knowledge that has been discovered to date. On the contrary, the growing need to tackle tomorrow’s problems with tomorrow’s solutions requires our children to become self-directed, lifelong learners equipped with the mindset, skillset and toolset to continually learn what they love and love what they learn. To do so, we seek to help them (i) find meaning in their learning, (ii) make learning memorable and (iii) create magic in learning.

**_Finding Meaning in Learning_**

For learning to flourish, it is fundamental to help our children find meaning in what they learn. Every child comes to us with an innate ability and curiosity to learn more about the fascinating world. It is then crucial for us to grow the joy of learning and develop the sense of wonder in them. Our signature programmes in STEM, Outdoor Education and Computational Thinking seek to augment the learning in classroom, enabling our children to see purpose in what they learn and to discover their strengths and interests at a young age. In 2022, the introduction of an hour of Independent Learning Periods (ILP) in the curriculum every week also provides the flexibility for HGPians to choose what they want to learn in class. Most of them are able to make responsible choices, by using the time to engage in meaningful learning activities, such as engaging in peer coaching, revising schoolwork, reading, doing art and craft, practising calligraphy and even learning foreign languages.

**_Making Learning Memorable_**

Learning from textbooks and high-stakes assessments is unlikely to stick in the long run. Most of us do not remember what we studied for our PSLE or even which textbooks we used back in our schooldays. To make learning truly memorable, children need to be actively involved in co-constructing new knowledge and skills through hands-on, interactive and real-world learning experiences. These are embedded in the broad range of programmes offered in the school, including learning journeys, camps and co-curricular activities (CCAs). Very often, the friendships forged among the children as they embark on these shared experiences will last them for life. In terms of classroom learning, the timely removal of mid-year examinations for all levels from this year onwards will free up time and space for teachers to adopt innovative strategies and tools to engage students, instead of spending excessive time on exam drills and practices. There will also be ample opportunities for students to collaborate in groups and learn from and with one another.

**_Creating Magic in Learning_**

During a magic show, the audience is typically mesmerised by counter-intuitive experiences that make them pause and ponder, “How did that happen?” Similarly, we want school-life to encompass magical experiences for our children as well, piquing their imagination and exciting them to step out of their comfort zone to discover new learning that they had never encountered before. Indeed, it is only by discovering the “a-ha” moments that they can truly love what they learn and create new magic in learning for themselves.

Last year, we published our first two issues of our _HGP Heartbeat_ school e-newsletter, capturing the stories and images of our students immersing themselves in many of the learning opportunities provided by the school.
