<p>“Come whatever on the road ahead</p>
<p>We did it before, and we’ll do it again.”</p>
<p><em>– </em>From<em> The Road Ahead </em>(NDP 2021 Theme Song)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>We Did It Before, and We Will Do It Again!</strong>
</p>
<p>Happy new year to all! A warm welcome to our new P1 students and parents.
To all our existing students, a very warm welcome back home. With the opening
of our new MOE Kindergarten MK@Hougang, I am also delighted to welcome
our K1 students and their parents to our newly expanded Hougang Primary
(HGP) family!</p>
<p>This year, we will be celebrating an important milestone, as HGP turns
25 and welcomes the birth of its kindergarten! While we mark the school’s
silver jubilee, i.e. HGP25, with pride and joy, it is important that we
reflect on our journey thus far and reimagine the road ahead to bring the
school forward.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since its founding at the start of the millennium, the school has focused
on holistic education and character development for our children. This
has enabled HGP to build a strong school identity and remain a choice school
in the northeastern region of Singapore. Today, HGPians enjoy a wide range
of learning opportunities outside the classroom, such as learning journeys,
school-based enrichment programmes and co-curricular activities (CCAs).
Our well-established Applied Learning Programme in Science and Learn for
Life Programme in Outdoor Education provide authentic, collaborative and
hands-on learning experiences that not only expand our children’s knowledge
beyond the textbook, but also deepen their values as well as strengthen
their socio-emotional competencies. Collectively, these have translated
to positive outcomes in terms of student engagement and performance, both
academically and non-academically. Indeed, we are immensely proud that
one of our students from the graduating cohort of 2023 received the prestigious
Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence (Primary Section) last year
for embodying our school motto for every child to Excel with Character.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In hindsight, the path taken by the school in the past 25 years has been
tremendously purposeful and rewarding. With the ongoing shifts in the education
landscape to better prepare students for an enigmatic and exciting future,
the road ahead for the school is likely to be filled with new and innumerable
possibilities for learning and growth, like when we first started our journey
more than two decades ago. This prompted us to take bold steps to transform
the learning spaces and experiences for our students, even as we stay committed
to our fundamental beliefs in holistic education and character development.
In 2024, we embarked on a reimagination and rebranding of the school library.
Called World of Wonders @ HGP, the newly renovated library aims to wow
the children in the future of learning, by piquing their curiosity and
arousing their interest in reading. The recent roll-out of the Emerging
21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies (E21CC) framework and Ed Tech Masterplan
initiative by MOE have also provided us with the impetus to redesign our
students’ learning. In line with these national imperatives, the school
will build on existing platforms and scale up innovative practices in the
coming years to accelerate our students’ acquisition and application of
the E21CC, as well as infuse technology-enabled learning experiences in
the curriculum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Last year, we engaged and empowered our staff, students, parents, alumni
and School Advisory Committee in the conceptualisation and painting of
a wall mural entitled “The Future of Singapore and Future of Learning”
outside the staff room. Under the guidance of a local artist, everyone
played a part to complete this meaningful and memorable masterpiece depicting
the future that we imagine collectively. As the school embarks on the road
ahead, we call on the continued support and partnership of all our stakeholders,
in order to turn any adversity and challenges into renewed hope and opportunities,
propelling us towards HGP50 and beyond. We did it before, and we will do
it again!</p>
<p>Happy 25<sup>th</sup> Birthday, HGP!</p>
