<p>“But if each of us does our part for the ‘we’ – care, contribute, and
look out for one another – then the ‘me’ will thrive and flourish too.”</p>
<p><em>– </em>Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, National Day Rally 2025</p>
<p><strong>Growing and Harnessing the Power of <em>Me</em> in a <em>We</em>-First Society</strong>
</p>
<p>Happy new year to all! A very warm welcome to our new P1 and K1 students,
as well as their parents. To all our existing students, a very warm welcome
back home!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We commemorated Hougang Primary’s (HGP’s) 25th anniversary, or Silver
Jubilee, with pride and joy last year. Besides celebrating the growth and
achievements of the school since it was founded, the momentous year also
marked the beginning of a new chapter in the HGP Story.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the National Day Rally in 2025, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong called
on Singaporeans to build a “we-first” society by uplifting one another
instead of just looking out for their self-interests. This message is clearly
encapsulated in our school vision to nurture our students into Future-Ready
Thinkers with a Heart for Others. Indeed, we firmly believe that all HGPians
hold the power to build a brighter future – not only for themselves but
also for the people around them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In HGP, we are committed to bring out the best in our children and help
them succeed in life, regardless of their starting point. The rapid proliferation
of educational technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) tools,
has enabled teachers to design more engaging and effective lessons, as
well as allowed students to access quality learning anytime and anywhere.
Beyond the classroom, HGPians continue to enjoy a rich buffet of learning
opportunities. The school’s Applied Learning Programme in Science and Learn
for Life Programme in Outdoor Education provide real-world and hands-on
learning experiences to deepen our students’ emerging 21st century competencies
(E21CC). Cognizant of our students’ diverse talents, they can choose from
a wide range of co-curricular activities (CCAs) designed to enable them
to discover their interests and develop their strengths. The school has
also transformed its learning spaces in recent years, such as our World
of Wonders (WOW) (i.e. school library), Abseiling Tower, and the newly
opened E21CC Learning Space, providing enriching environments that promote
curiosity and build resilience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By helping our students find purpose and success in life, we believe that
they will be better able and more motivated to pay it forward. A “we-first
society” is not about putting self below others, but rather about recognising
that our individual strengths shine brightest when used to uplift one another.
Whether it’s a student helping a classmate, a teacher inspiring a student,
or a parent partnering a teacher, every act matters. Ultimately, “we” must
begin with “me” – my beliefs, my choices and most importantly, my action.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The need to instill care and compassion in our young has come to the fore
in a world that is becoming increasingly disrupted and divided. To do so,
the school has ramped up its efforts in the Values-in-Action (VIA) curriculum,
by introducing a school-wide “Together With Grands (TWG)” intergenerational
learning programme. Students learn and apply the values of respect, kindness
and empathy when interacting with and engaging seniors from various Active
Aging Centres. Staff also lead by example through their participation in
the Food From The Heart (FFTH) initiative, by delivering monthly food hampers
to families in need. Over time, these collective and concerted efforts
will go a long way in building a more compassionate school and nation that
leave no one behind.</p>
<p>Hence, as we chart our way forward from HGP25 to HGP50, let us continue
to grow and harness the power of me in a we-first society – one where every
individual says “I can, I care, and I contribute” with both confidence
and conviction. Here's to a fruitful and fulfilling year ahead!</p>
