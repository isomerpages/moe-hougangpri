In support of HPBâ€™s strategy to cultivate healthy eating habits in children, our school has implemented the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme (HMSP) since 11 July 2016.

The programme aims to achieve the following objectives:

Increase awareness of healthy nutrition
Increase consumption of fruit, vegetables and whole-grains
Reduce intake of high fat, salt and sugar
Under this programme, stallholders will be selling set meal that consists of the four food groups, ie. rice/noodles, meat, vegetable and fruit. The set meal will come in small or big portion that ranges from $1.30 to $2.00. The Canteen Menu can be found below.
