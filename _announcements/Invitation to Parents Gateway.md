<p>We would like to invite you to downloadthe Parents Gateway mobile app on your mobile phone (available on iOS and Android platforms only) and perform a simple one-time onboarding process from now to 31 Mar 2019. You can download the instructions&nbsp;<a href="/files/Parents%20Gateway.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>From 1 April 2019 (Term 2), parents who are onboard Parents Gateway will receive information via the mobile app. Parents who have yet to come onboard will receive circulars to parents in hardcopy.</p>
<p>We look forward to your support. Thank you very much!</p>
