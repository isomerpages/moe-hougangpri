<p>The Drama Club CCA aims to develop students who are creative, confident, and expressive in their performances. Students will be developed in their oral communication, literacy &amp; collaborative skills. Opportunities will be given to them to perform at various platforms and appreciate theatrical performances by attending workshops and plays organised by external agencies such as SOTA and ACT3. </p>
<p>Students will be exposed to theatre techniques and learn to express themselves confidently. They will also get the chance to experience the excitement and rewards of theatre arts while developing poise, social skills, confidence and the ability to work with others.</p>
