<p>Green Club is made up of students who believe in doing their part to protect Mother Earth through their actions. CCA sessions see students conserving native species in the school native species trail by planting the plants collected by NParks from the land cleared for other purposes and doing stem-cutting to ensure continuity of these species. The CCA also provides opportunities for students to reflect on food wastage and its impact on the environment through its wormery and food composting projects. The Green Club members also maintain the school&rsquo;s butterfly garden and green wall and through these, they learn more about the importance of pollinators and plants to the environment. Students in the Green Club will be provided with opportunities to share their experiences with their peers and members of the public to create greater awareness in biodiversity and environmental issues.</p>
