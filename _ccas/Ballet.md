<p><strong>EXPLORATION AND FUN IN EVERY BALLET LESSON</strong></p>
<p>The Ballet CCA aims to establish principles of classical ballet and incorporate modern dance steps to be more diversification. During the practice sessions, the ballerinas will be exposed to the different aesthetics techniques e.g.; pointe work, turnout of the legs and high extensions: rises, releve, tendu &amp; transfer of weight, glisse, jete, assemble, pas de chat, pose, detourne, soutenu. Creativity, focus and fun are the main objectives for each session. Ballerinas use port de bras and adage to develop movement dynamics, and flow in movements for longer dance sequences. There will be opportunities to display their performances at various platforms and learn from the professionals. Opportunity will be provided to expose, inspire and help ballerinas to see the outcome of practise and hard work, by attending ballet performance annually.</p>
