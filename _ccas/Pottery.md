<p>Pottery CCA aims to enhance creativity, spatial intelligence and fine-motor skills development among members. Hand pinching, slabbing and coiling using the pottery banding wheel are some of the techniques that students would be learning during CCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To nurture responsible students who contribute to society, pottery members conduct workshop for the seniors under the Intergenerational Learning Programme. They will also have opportunities to teach their parents and family members how to make ceramic artwork during the Annual Parents&rsquo; Workshop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning journey to various organizations such as Dragon&rsquo;s kiln and National Gallery of Singapore are organized to provide breadth of experiences for the students, and their artwork is showcased during the annual school exhibition.</p>
