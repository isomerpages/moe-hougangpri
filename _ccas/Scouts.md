<p>HGP Cub Scouts aims to inculcate discipline, leadership qualities and teamwork in our students through lifeskills lessons and outdoor activities. This CCA caters to students who are keen to learn and explore a multiplicity of hobbies such as book readings and stamp collecting. The students will also explore and learn skills such as reading maps, administering first-aid and tying knobs and lashings instead of specialising in one specific skill. To enhance the Joy of Learning, the students go for experiential trips and attend courses. Students are imbued with all the four school values (Care, Integrity, Resilience and Responsibility) as they work in teams during different activities such as tent pitching, competitions and camp activities.</p>
