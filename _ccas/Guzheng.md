<p>The Guzheng CCA aims to arouse and sustain students&rsquo; interest in the instrument with 2500 years of history.&nbsp; Learning to play the Guzheng, gives our members deep insights into the Chinese history and culture. Students will play both traditional and contemporary music and have opportunities to perform at various platforms. During the course of the CCA, instructors will enrich the students&rsquo; learning as they share the stories behind the music pieces they teach. &nbsp; They will also have opportunities to work in teams to develop teamwork, cooperation and enhance communication skills.</p>
