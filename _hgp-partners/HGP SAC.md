<p>Hougang Primary School's School Advisory Committee was set up in 2001.
Since its inception, the committee members have made significant contributions
to our school. They work closely with the school management, provide strong
support to school programmes and help to raise funds for school development
and to mount enrichment programmes for studentsâ€™ holistic development.&nbsp;
<br>Currently, our SAC comprises community leaders, grassroots leaders, professionals
and parents of existing students.
