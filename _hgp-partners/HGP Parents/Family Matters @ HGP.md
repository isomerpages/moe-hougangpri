<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>During your child&rsquo;s development years, you may, from time to time, encounter parenting challenges, ranging from disobedience to temper tantrums. Some of these challenges may intensify over time, particularly when children reach their tweens (9 -12 years old) and teens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support you in your parenting needs, Hougang Primary School has been partnering the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).</p>
<p>MSF has assigned a social service agency, Methodist Welfare Services, to work with the school to provide an evidence-based programme - Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P), Level 2. Through workshops, the programme seeks to equip parents with knowledge, skills and confidence to nurture positive family relationships. This support for parents is done in partnership with stakeholders including school personnel, Family Service Centres and other community partners of MSF.</p>
<p>Triple P can result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>greater parenting competence</li>
<li>lower parenting stress</li>
<li>improved emotional states</li>
<li>reduced behavioural problems in children</li>
</ul>
<p>The teacher in charge of the partnership with Methodist Welfare Services &amp; MSF can be contacted at <a href="mailto:arlitaharianty_sayrol@moe.edu.sg">arlitaharianty_sayrol@moe.edu.sg</a>.</p>
