<h4>Is&nbsp;Discipline = Punishment?</h4>
<h4><strong>How Do You React When Things Go Wrong?</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>During your childâ€™s development years, you may, from time to time, encounter
parenting challenges, ranging from disobedience to temper tantrums. Some
of these challenges may intensify over time, particularly when children
reach their tweens (9 -12 years old) and teens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support you in your parenting needs, Hougang Primary School has been
partnering the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).</p>
<p>MSF has assigned a social service agency, Methodist Welfare Services,
to work with the school to provide an evidence-based programme - Positive
Parenting Programme (Triple P), Level 2. Through workshops, the programme
seeks to equip parents with knowledge, skills and confidence to nurture
positive family relationships. This support for parents is done in partnership
with stakeholders including school personnel, Family Service Centres and
other community partners of MSF.</p>
<p>Triple P can result in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>greater parenting competence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lower parenting stress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improved emotional states</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reduced behavioural problems in children</p>
</li>
</ul>
